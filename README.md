Accessible Mobile Banking App Prototype
Project Overview
This project is a mobile banking app prototype designed to follow Universal Design, Inclusive Design, and Accessibility principles. It focuses on creating a banking interface that is usable by people with motor disabilities, ensuring ease of navigation, large touch targets, and keyboard accessibility. The prototype is developed using JustInMind Prototyper, with version control managed through GitHub.

Scenario
The project follows Scenario 2 from the HCI activity instructions:
Design a mobile banking app that is inclusive for users with motor disabilities, focusing on ease of navigation and large touch targets.

Accessibility Features
The following accessibility features were integrated based on WCAG 2.1 guidelines and Universal Design principles:

Large Touch Targets: Buttons and interactive elements are designed with larger dimensions, making them easier to tap for users with motor disabilities.
Keyboard Navigation: All elements can be accessed via keyboard shortcuts, ensuring users who cannot use a mouse can still navigate the app.
High-Contrast Colors: The interface uses accessible color contrast ratios for readability, particularly for users with low vision.
Screen Reader Compatibility: The app is structured to ensure compatibility with screen readers, including properly labeled input fields and buttons.
Error and Success Feedback: Users receive clear feedback during key interactions (e.g., login success/failure, transaction confirmations).
Key Screens and Interactions
The prototype consists of the following key screens:

Home Screen:

"Log In" button with large, accessible text and spacing.
Navigation links (Account Info, Settings, Help) in the footer for easy access.
Login Screen:

Large text boxes for Username and Password, fully operable via keyboard.
"Login" button with feedback for success or failure.
"Forgot Password" option with easy access.
Account Overview:

Account balance displayed in large text.
"Transfer Funds" and "Transaction History" buttons, both with large touch targets.
Prototype Development
Prototyping Tool: JustInMind Prototyper
